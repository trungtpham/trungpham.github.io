Welcome!

I am a Sr. Computer Vision Scientist at NVIDIA, where I am working on visual perception algorithms for driverless cars. Prior to NVIDIA, I was a research fellow at the Australian Centre of Robotic Vision. I secured my PhD in Computer Vision in 2014 from the University of Adelaide. In 2013, I was one of 200 young researchers worldwide invited to attend Heidelberg Laureate Forum. I was awarded a Google PhD Fellowship in 2012.
